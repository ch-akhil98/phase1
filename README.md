Algorithm : When the program runs , display screen shows the website name of LockedMe.com and the developer name who has build it,
main menu is displayed with the options for show files , show file option menu and quit the application
when we select the respective options(1,2,3) then for each case the switch will be called and the desired 
operation is performed. when 1 it shows the files in ascending order , here sorting technique is being used
when pressed 2 it shows file option menu for adding , deleting , searching the different files. Here Display interface 
is created in which data abstraction is achieved. which will hide all the implementation details and show only essential 
information to the user.Scanner class is used to take the inputs. in this the files are stored in a specefic directory
under the main project, from which we can access and able to modify the files according to the user needs. after the 
operation is performed when we choose 3 then the application exits.
